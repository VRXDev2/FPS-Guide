# Introduction
Hello! If you're having issues with FPS in Minecraft on versions 1.19.4 - 1.20.6, this is the perfect solution for you!
If you do not know how to install mods, here are some tutorials:
* Most Minecraft launchers, excluding TLauncher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cDpzTyGC9Q
* TLauncher:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzhWkNRtkcA
## The installation process is pretty much the same for all versions.

# What mods to install?
This depends on what version you are on, but as long as the mod supports the version you're planning to use - you should be all good.
Anyways, here's a list along with supported versions as of me writing this.
